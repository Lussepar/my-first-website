# My First Website

## Features 
- Links to socials
- Gallery
- About me
- Hidden button, leading to secret page ( Coming later.. )
- Music player ( Coming later.. )

## Vision board
- Dark/Neon aesthetic
- Animated Background made by pixelart displaying skyline of rooftops ( Coming later..)
- Set in night with starry/glowing sky ( Coming later.. )
- The secret page should stop the music and display nothing but a black window with some cool ASCII art ( Coming later.. )

## To-do:

- [ ] Fix space inbetween borders of the links to socials (Squeeze together negative space)
- [ ] Format the "About this page" more neatly
- [ ] Find and try new font-family. (Old english if possible or similar font)

## To-do later:

- [ ] Research about music players in web browsers
- [ ] Research about programmable button, placing it on the screen, leading to a new hidden page
- [ ] Research about ASCII-art
- [ ] How to animate with text (Marquee, or will I get lynched..? )

More notes coming soon..
