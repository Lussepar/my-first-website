## Vision board
- Dark/Neon aesthetic
- Animated Background made by pixelart displaying skyline of rooftops ( Coming later..)
- Set in night with starry/glowing sky ( Coming later.. )
- The secret page should stop the music and display nothing but a black window with some cool ASCII art ( Coming later.. )

## To-do:

- [ ] Research about ASCII-art
- [X] How to animate with text (Marquee, or will I get lynched..? )

More notes coming soon..
